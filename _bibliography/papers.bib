  abstract = "There are more and more data concerning the role of cellular
              metabolism in innate immune cells, such as macrophages or
              conventional dendritic cells. However, few data are available
              currently concerning plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC), another
              type of innate immune cells. These cells are the main type I
              interferon (IFN) producing cells, but they also secrete other
              pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor or
              interleukin [IL]-6) or immunomodulatory factors (e.g., IL-10 or
              transforming growth factor-$\beta$). Through these functions, PDC
              participate in antimicrobial responses or maintenance of immune
              tolerance, and have been implicated in the pathophysiology of
              several autoimmune diseases, as well as in tumor immune escape
              mechanisms. Recent data support the idea that the glycolytic
              pathway (or glycolysis), as well as lipid metabolism (including
              both cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism) may impact some
              innate immune functions of PDC or may be involved in these
              functions after Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/9 triggering. The
              kinetics of glycolysis after TLR7/9 triggering may differ between
              human and murine PDC. In mouse PDC, metabolism changes promoted
              by TLR7/9 activation may depend on an autocrine/paracrine loop,
              implicating type I IFN and its receptor IFNAR. This could explain
              a delayed glycolysis in mouse PDC. Moreover, PDC functions can be
              modulated by the metabolism of cholesterol and fatty acids. This
              may occur via the production of lipid ligands that activate
              nuclear receptors (e.g., liver X receptor [LXR]) in PDC or
              through limiting intracellular cholesterol pool size (by statin
              or LXR agonist treatment) in these cells. Finally,
              lipid-activated nuclear receptors (i.e., LXR or peroxisome
              proliferator activated receptor) may also directly interact with
              pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as NF-$\kappa$B.
              Here, we discuss how glycolysis and lipid metabolism may modulate
              PDC functions and how this may be harnessed in pathological
              situations where PDC play a detrimental role.",

               to decipher the role of LXRs in the regulation of
               polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthesis in macrophages in
               the context of atherosclerosis. APPROACH AND RESULTS:
               Transcriptomic analysis in human monocytes and macrophages was
               used to identify putative LXR target genes among enzymes
               involved in PUFA biosynthesis. In parallel, the consequences of
               LXR activation or LXR invalidation on PUFA synthesis and
               distribution were determined. Finally, we investigated the
               impact of LXR activation on PUFA metabolism in vivo in
               apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. mRNA levels of acyl-CoA
               synthase long-chain family member 3, fatty acid desaturases 1
               and 2, and fatty acid elongase 5 were significantly increased in
               human macrophages after LXR agonist treatment, involving both
               direct and sterol responsive element binding protein-1-dependent
               mechanisms. Subsequently, pharmacological LXR agonist increased
               long chain PUFA synthesis and enhanced arachidonic acid content
               in the phospholipids of human macrophages. Increased fatty acid
               desaturases 1 and 2 and acyl-CoA synthase long-chain family
               member 3 mRNA levels as well as increased arachidonic acid to
               linoleic acid and docosahexaenoic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid
               ratios were also found in atheroma plaque and peritoneal foam
               cells from LXR agonist-treated mice. By contrast, murine
               LXR-deficient macrophages displayed reduced expression of fatty
               acid elongase 5, acyl-CoA synthase long-chain family member 3
               and fatty acid desaturases 1, as well as decreased cellular
               levels of docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid.
               CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that LXR activation triggers
               PUFA synthesis in macrophages, which results in significant
               alterations in the macrophage lipid composition. Moreover, we
               demonstrate here that LXR agonist treatment modulates PUFA
               metabolism in atherosclerotic arteries.",

               nuclear receptors that are highly expressed in macrophages and
               regulate lipid homeostasis and inflammation. Among putative LXR
               target genes, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3)
               involved in the Lands cycle controls the fatty acid composition
               at the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids and, therefore, the
               availability of fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid (AA), used
               for eicosanoid synthesis. The aim of our study was to determine
               whether LXRs could regulate the Lands cycle in human
               macrophages, to assess the consequences in terms of lipid
               composition and inflammatory response, and to work out the
               relative contribution of LPCAT3 to the observed changes.
               APPROACH AND RESULTS: Transcriptomic analysis revealed that
               LPCAT3 was upregulated by LXR agonists in human macrophages.
               Accordingly, LXR stimulation significantly increased
               lysophospholipid acyltransferase activity catalyzed by LPCAT3.
               Lipidomic analysis demonstrated that LXR activation increased
               the AA content in the polar lipid fraction, specifically in
               phosphatidylcholines. The LXR-mediated effects on AA
               distribution were abolished by LPCAT3 silencing, and a
               redistribution of AA toward the neutral lipid fraction was
               observed in this context. Finally, we observed that
               preconditioning of human macrophages by LXR agonist treatment
               increased the release of arachidonate-derived eicosanoids, such
               as prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane after lipopolysaccharide
               stimulation, with a significant attenuation by LPCAT3 silencing.
               CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our data demonstrate that the
               LXR-mediated induction of LPCAT3 primes human macrophages for
               subsequent eicosanoid secretion by increasing the pool of AA,
               which can be mobilized from phospholipids.",

               lipid metabolism and inflammation. Pharmacological activation of
               LXR is promising in the treatment of atherosclerosis since it
               can promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages and prevent foam
               cell formation. However, the development of LXR agonists has
               been limited by undesirable side-effects such as hepatic
               steatosis mediated by LXR$\alpha$ activation. Therefore, it has
               been proposed that targeting LXR$\alpha$ activators to
               extrahepatic tissues or using LXR$\beta$-specific activators
               could be used as alternative strategies. It is not clear whether
               these molecules will retain the full atheroprotective potential
               of non-selective agonists. Our aim was therefore to determine
               the contribution of LXR$\alpha$ and LXR$\beta$ to the control of
               cholesterol efflux in human macrophages. LXR$\alpha$ and/or
               LXR$\beta$ expression was suppressed by small interfering RNAs

               LXR$\alpha$/$\beta$ dual agonists T0901317 and GW3965. We
               observed that LXR$\beta$ silencing had no detectable impact on
               the expression of LXR-target genes such as ABCA1 and ABCG1.
               Moreover it did not affect cholesterol efflux. In contrast,
               LXR$\alpha$ silencing reduced the response of these LXR-target
               genes to LXR agonist and inhibited cholesterol efflux to ApoA-I,
               HDL2 or to endogenous ApoE. Importantly, no differences were
               observed between LXR$\alpha$ and LXR$\alpha$/$\beta$ knockdown
               conditions. Altogether, our data demonstrate that LXR$\beta$
               activation is unable to maintain maximal cholesterol efflux
               capacities in human primary macrophages when LXR$\alpha$
               expression is impaired. In contrast to earlier mouse studies,
               LXR$\alpha$ levels appear as a limiting factor for macrophage

               cells. The effects of 4$\alpha$- and 4$\beta$-hydroxycholesterol
               were studied on 158N murine oligodendrocytes to assess their
               activities on cell growth and viability, oxidative and
               inflammatory status. To this end different parameters were used:
               cell counting with trypan blue; identification of dead cells and
               cell cycle analysis with propidium iodide; evaluation of
               mitochondrial depolarization, lysosomal membrane integrity,
               actin depolimerization, nuclear morphology, and superoxide anion
               production after staining with JC-1, acridine orange,
               rhodamine-phalloidin, Hoechst 33342, and dihydroethidium,
               respectively; evaluation of ultrastructural changes by
               transmission electron microscopy, and cytokine quantification
               with a cytometric bead array. Only 4$\beta$-hydroxycholesterol
               is a LXR$\alpha$ and $\beta$ agonist. No cytotoxic effects were
               found with 4$\alpha$-hydroxycholesterol except a slight
               inhibition of cell growth at elevated concentrations. At high
               concentrations, 4$\beta$-hydroxycholesterol was not only able to
               inhibit cell growth, but also to induce cell death associated
               with a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential,
               dysfunctions of lysosomal membrane integrity, and superoxide
               anion overproduction. These side effects were lower than those
               observed with 7-ketocholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol used
               as positive controls. On oligodendrocyte murine primary
               cultures, only lysosomal membrane integrity was slightly
               affected under treatment with 4$\alpha$- and
               4$\beta$-hydroxycholesterol. So, 4$\alpha$- and
               4$\beta$-hydroxycholesterol have different biological
               activities. Their ability to induce cytotoxic effects on
               oligodendrocytes can be considered as weak comparatively to

A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
