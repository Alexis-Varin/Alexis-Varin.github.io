              Bulk RNA-sequencing, RT-PCR and immunofluorescence analyses were
              performed from temporal arteries from GCA, PMR and control
              patients. Public single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data on
              Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were analyzed from
              three GCA and three control patients. Bulk RNA-Seq and RT-PCR
              analyses demonstrated a high level of expression of DC lineage
              markers (CD209), DC maturation markers (CD83, CCR7) and
              chemokines associated with DC maturation in GCA arteries. The

  abstract = "Elimination of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages, a process
              called efferocytosis, is a critical step in the resolution of
              inflammation. Efferocytosis induces the reprogramming of
              macrophages towards a pro-resolving phenotype and triggers the
              secretion of pro-resolving factors. While mouse efferocytic
              macrophages are well-described, less is known about human
              efferocytic macrophages. Here, using RNA sequencing analysis of
              three different types of in vitro-derived human efferocytic
              macrophages, we observed a common modulation of mitochondrial
              metabolism-related genes in human M0, M1, and M2a-like
              macrophages, thus correlating with some previous results obtained
              in other non-human models. These results led us to identify for
              the first time some particular genes regulated in humans like
              PLIN5 and MTLN. We also shed light on a mitochondrial gene
              (MT-RNR2) coding a secreted factor called HUMANIN. Mainly known
              for its antioxidant and neuroprotective effects, we found that
              HUMANIN was also associated with pro-resolving properties in
              human and mouse models. Indeed, HUMANIN was produced early during
              the resolution of inflammation in an acute peritonitis mouse
              model. Preventive HUMANIN administration in this model reduced
              leukocyte infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion.
              These anti-inflammatory properties were accompanied by the early
              acquisition of a CD11b(low) non-efferocytic phenotype by mouse
              macrophages and by an enhanced expression of pro-resolving genes
              including Alox15 and Retnla. The ability of HUMANIN to dampen
              pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion was also confirmed in primary
              human neutrophils. Finally, HUMANIN was also detected in gingival
              crevicular fluids of patients suffering from periodontitis after
              the onset of inflammation, suggesting a role of HUMANIN in the
              control of inflammation. Overall, our data shed light on new
              aspects of efferocytosis in humans and identify the pro-resolving
              potential of HUMANIN. This illustrates its prospective
              therapeutic interest in inflammatory disorders.",

              in allograft injuries after solid organ transplantation is
              essential for precise definitions of rejection subtypes and
              improved overall outcomes. High throughput technologies and the
              recently available computational methods make it now possible to
              address such complex biological questions. Here, we performed a
              unique compilation of six omics datasets (170,000 variables) from
              a multi-center study encompassing 131 kidney transplant
              recipients. METHODS: Using multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA), we
              investigated sources of variability in patient blood, urine and
              their allograft at the epigenetic and transcriptomic levels.
              RESULTS: Integrating the different omics layers, MOFA delimited
              eight hidden factors in an unsupervised manner. We identified
              specific factors that reflect allograft rejection and their
              multicellular complex immune profiles, complement activation,

              major compartments of the kidney, next to infiltrated immune
              cells. Endothelial cells from the glomerulus, peritubular

              alterations in liver Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) are
              observed in MASH in humans, a causal relationship of PUFAs
              biosynthetic pathways is yet to be clarified. ELOVL5, an
              essential enzyme in PUFA elongation regulates hepatic
              triglyceride metabolism. Nonetheless, the long-term consequences
              of elongase disruption, particularly in murine models of MASH,
              have not been evaluated. APPROACH \& RESULTS: In humans,
              transcriptomic data indicated that PUFAs biosynthesis enzymes and
              notably ELOVL5 were induced during MASH progression. Moreover,
              gene module association determination revealed that ELOVL5
              expression was associated with mitochondrial function in both
              humans and mice. WT and Elovl5-deficient mice were fed a
              high-fat, high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet for four months. Elovl5
              deficiency led to limited systemic metabolic alterations but
              significant hepatic phenotype was observed in Elovl5-/- mice
              after the HF/HS diet, including hepatomegaly, pronounced
              macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis, hepatocyte
              ballooning, immune cell infiltration, and fibrosis. Lipid
              analysis confirmed hepatic triglyceride accumulation and a
              reshaping of FA profile. Transcriptomic analysis indicated
              significant upregulation of genes involved in immune cell
              recruitment and fibrosis, and downregulation of genes involved in
              oxidative phosphorylation in Elovl5-/- mice. Alterations of FA
              oxidation and energy metabolism were confirmed by non-targeted
              metabolomic approach. Analysis of mitochondrial function in
              Elovl5-/- mice showed morphological alterations, qualitative
              cardiolipin changes with an enrichment in species containing
              shorter unsaturated FAs, and decreased activity of I and III
              respiratory chain complexes. CONCLUSION: Enhanced susceptibility
              to diet-induced MASH and fibrosis in Elovl5-/- mice is
              intricately associated with disruptions in mitochondrial

              marked by chronic inflammation. While most therapeutics target
              inflammatory molecules and inflammatory effector cells and
              mediators, targeting macrophages to initiate inflammation
              resolution to control neuroinflammation has not yet been
              attempted. Resolution-phase macrophages are critical in the
              resolution process to regain tissue homeostasis, and are
              programmed through the presence and elimination of apoptotic
              leukocytes. Hence, inducing resolution-phase macrophages might
              represent an innovative therapeutic approach to control and
              terminate dysregulated neuroinflammation. METHODS: Here, we
              investigated if the factors released by in vitro induced
              resolution-phase macrophages (their secretome) are able to
              therapeutically reprogram macrophages to control
              neuroinflammation in the model of experimental autoimmune

              in the concentration of LTB4 and RvD1 as well as selected
              cyclooxygenase-derived mediators in carotid plaques from diabetic
              and non-diabetic patients. We also aimed to analyze the
              relationship between omega 6 and omega 3 Poly-Unsaturated Fatty
              acids (PUFAs) content in the plaques and the concentrations of
              these lipid mediators. METHODS: 29 type 2 diabetic patients and
              30 control patients admitted for surgical treatment of carotid
              stenosis were enrolled in the present study. Carotid plaques were
              harvested for in-depth lipidomic profiling. RESULTS: No
              differences for LTB4 or other lipid mediators were observed
              between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. RvD1 levels were
              below the threshold of quantification in most of the samples. A
              significant correlation was found between LTB4 and 5(S)-HETE
              levels. Omega 3 enrichment was not significantly different
              between control and diabetic plaques. There was a negative
              correlation between DHA/AA ratio and the level of 5(S)-HETE while
              there was a positive association with TXB2 and PGD2
              concentrations. CONCLUSION-PERSPECTIVES: Our results does not
              support the hypothesis of a specific involvement of LTB4 or
              COX-derived mediators in diabetic atherosclerosis. The
              relationship between DHA enrichment and the concentrations of
              specific inflammatory mediators within the plaque is of interest
              and will need to be confirmed in larger studies.",

              metabolism in innate immune cells, such as macrophages or
              conventional dendritic cells. However, few data are available
              currently concerning plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC), another
              type of innate immune cells. These cells are the main type I
              interferon (IFN) producing cells, but they also secrete other
              pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor or
              interleukin [IL]-6) or immunomodulatory factors (e.g., IL-10 or
              transforming growth factor-$\beta$). Through these functions, PDC
              participate in antimicrobial responses or maintenance of immune
              tolerance, and have been implicated in the pathophysiology of
              several autoimmune diseases, as well as in tumor immune escape
              mechanisms. Recent data support the idea that the glycolytic
              pathway (or glycolysis), as well as lipid metabolism (including
              both cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism) may impact some
              innate immune functions of PDC or may be involved in these
              functions after Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/9 triggering. The
              kinetics of glycolysis after TLR7/9 triggering may differ between
              human and murine PDC. In mouse PDC, metabolism changes promoted
              by TLR7/9 activation may depend on an autocrine/paracrine loop,
              implicating type I IFN and its receptor IFNAR. This could explain
              a delayed glycolysis in mouse PDC. Moreover, PDC functions can be
              modulated by the metabolism of cholesterol and fatty acids. This
              may occur via the production of lipid ligands that activate
              nuclear receptors (e.g., liver X receptor [LXR]) in PDC or
              through limiting intracellular cholesterol pool size (by statin
              or LXR agonist treatment) in these cells. Finally,
              lipid-activated nuclear receptors (i.e., LXR or peroxisome
              proliferator activated receptor) may also directly interact with
              pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as NF-$\kappa$B.
              Here, we discuss how glycolysis and lipid metabolism may modulate
              PDC functions and how this may be harnessed in pathological
              situations where PDC play a detrimental role.",

               to decipher the role of LXRs in the regulation of
               polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthesis in macrophages in
               the context of atherosclerosis. APPROACH AND RESULTS:
               Transcriptomic analysis in human monocytes and macrophages was
               used to identify putative LXR target genes among enzymes
               involved in PUFA biosynthesis. In parallel, the consequences of
               LXR activation or LXR invalidation on PUFA synthesis and
               distribution were determined. Finally, we investigated the
               impact of LXR activation on PUFA metabolism in vivo in
               apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. mRNA levels of acyl-CoA
               synthase long-chain family member 3, fatty acid desaturases 1
               and 2, and fatty acid elongase 5 were significantly increased in
               human macrophages after LXR agonist treatment, involving both
               direct and sterol responsive element binding protein-1-dependent
               mechanisms. Subsequently, pharmacological LXR agonist increased
               long chain PUFA synthesis and enhanced arachidonic acid content
               in the phospholipids of human macrophages. Increased fatty acid
               desaturases 1 and 2 and acyl-CoA synthase long-chain family
               member 3 mRNA levels as well as increased arachidonic acid to
               linoleic acid and docosahexaenoic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid
               ratios were also found in atheroma plaque and peritoneal foam
               cells from LXR agonist-treated mice. By contrast, murine
               LXR-deficient macrophages displayed reduced expression of fatty
               acid elongase 5, acyl-CoA synthase long-chain family member 3
               and fatty acid desaturases 1, as well as decreased cellular
               levels of docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid.
               CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that LXR activation triggers
               PUFA synthesis in macrophages, which results in significant
               alterations in the macrophage lipid composition. Moreover, we
               demonstrate here that LXR agonist treatment modulates PUFA

               nuclear receptors that are highly expressed in macrophages and
               regulate lipid homeostasis and inflammation. Among putative LXR
               target genes, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3)
               involved in the Lands cycle controls the fatty acid composition
               at the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids and, therefore, the
               availability of fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid (AA), used
               for eicosanoid synthesis. The aim of our study was to determine
               whether LXRs could regulate the Lands cycle in human
               macrophages, to assess the consequences in terms of lipid
               composition and inflammatory response, and to work out the
               relative contribution of LPCAT3 to the observed changes.
               APPROACH AND RESULTS: Transcriptomic analysis revealed that
               LPCAT3 was upregulated by LXR agonists in human macrophages.
               Accordingly, LXR stimulation significantly increased
               lysophospholipid acyltransferase activity catalyzed by LPCAT3.
               Lipidomic analysis demonstrated that LXR activation increased
               the AA content in the polar lipid fraction, specifically in
               phosphatidylcholines. The LXR-mediated effects on AA
               distribution were abolished by LPCAT3 silencing, and a
               redistribution of AA toward the neutral lipid fraction was
               observed in this context. Finally, we observed that
               preconditioning of human macrophages by LXR agonist treatment
               increased the release of arachidonate-derived eicosanoids, such
               as prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane after lipopolysaccharide
               stimulation, with a significant attenuation by LPCAT3 silencing.
               CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our data demonstrate that the
               LXR-mediated induction of LPCAT3 primes human macrophages for
               subsequent eicosanoid secretion by increasing the pool of AA,

               oxysterol-activated nuclear receptors involved in the control of
               lipid metabolism and inflammation. Pharmacological activation of
               LXR is promising in the treatment of atherosclerosis since it
               can promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages and prevent foam
               cell formation. However, the development of LXR agonists has
               been limited by undesirable side-effects such as hepatic
               steatosis mediated by LXR$\alpha$ activation. Therefore, it has
               been proposed that targeting LXR$\alpha$ activators to
               extrahepatic tissues or using LXR$\beta$-specific activators
               could be used as alternative strategies. It is not clear whether
               these molecules will retain the full atheroprotective potential
               of non-selective agonists. Our aim was therefore to determine
               the contribution of LXR$\alpha$ and LXR$\beta$ to the control of
               cholesterol efflux in human macrophages. LXR$\alpha$ and/or
               LXR$\beta$ expression was suppressed by small interfering RNAs

               LXR$\alpha$/$\beta$ dual agonists T0901317 and GW3965. We
               observed that LXR$\beta$ silencing had no detectable impact on
               the expression of LXR-target genes such as ABCA1 and ABCG1.
               Moreover it did not affect cholesterol efflux. In contrast,
               LXR$\alpha$ silencing reduced the response of these LXR-target
               genes to LXR agonist and inhibited cholesterol efflux to ApoA-I,
               HDL2 or to endogenous ApoE. Importantly, no differences were
               observed between LXR$\alpha$ and LXR$\alpha$/$\beta$ knockdown
               conditions. Altogether, our data demonstrate that LXR$\beta$
               activation is unable to maintain maximal cholesterol efflux
               capacities in human primary macrophages when LXR$\alpha$
               expression is impaired. In contrast to earlier mouse studies,
               LXR$\alpha$ levels appear as a limiting factor for macrophage

               activities on cell growth and viability, oxidative and

               with a cytometric bead array. Only 4$\beta$-hydroxycholesterol
               is a LXR$\alpha$ and $\beta$ agonist. No cytotoxic effects were
               found with 4$\alpha$-hydroxycholesterol except a slight

               inhibit cell growth, but also to induce cell death associated
               with a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential,
               dysfunctions of lysosomal membrane integrity, and superoxide
               anion overproduction. These side effects were lower than those
