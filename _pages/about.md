Welcome to my GitHub portfolio, where you will find an overview of the bioinformatic analyses and visualizations I develop for internal and collaborative research projects.

I am a research engineer in the <a href="https://umr-right.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inserm UMR Right (U1098) lab</a> who focuses mainly on the analysis of transcriptomic data, such as bulk RNA-seq and microarray, and specialize in single-cell RNA-Seq, where I have developed an expertise in a large array of methods: alignment of sequenced data, Seurat analysis (QC, integration, etc) and more specialized analyses such as pseudotime inference, cell-cell communication, variant calling, and much more... You can contact me using the links in the navigation bar.
