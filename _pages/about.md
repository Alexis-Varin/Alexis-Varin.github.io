Welcome to my GitHub portfolio, where you will find an overview of the bioinformatic analyses, scripts, and visualizations I develop for internal and collaborative research projects.

I am a research engineer in the Inserm UMR RIGHT (U1098) lab who focuses mainly on the analysis of transcriptomic data, such as bulk RNA-seq and microarray, and specialize in single-cell RNA-Seq, where I have developed an expertise in a large array of methods: alignment of sequenced data, Seurat analysis (QC, integration, etc) and more specialized analyses such as pseudotime inference, cell-cell communication, variant calling, and much more... Feel free to browse the different sections, and don’t hesitate to reach out using the contact details above if you have any questions or would like to inquire about a collaboration on your project.
