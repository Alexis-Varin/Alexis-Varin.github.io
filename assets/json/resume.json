For example, I serve as a liaison, leveraging my scientific background and certification as a patient expert, between patients (their expectations, their difficulties, etc.) and healthcare professionals or even health authorities. Additionally, I participate in the organization of various informational meetings and annual conferences (such as the 'SMA Day'), gathering up to several hundred patients and their families to disseminate and simplify the latest therapeutic advances and inform them about patient rights."
